Ireland will be proud of their effort in this game and now the focus shifts to the last phase of the tour as the two teams clash in a one-off Test match. That game will be played on Tuesday 4th April and the match will start at 9.30 am IST (4 am GMT) but as you know you can join us well in advance for the build-up. Until then, goodbye and cheers!!Paul Sterling the skipper of Ireland is also the Player of the Match for his quickfire 77 in 41 balls. He says that the bowlers set the tone for this game with a brilliant bowling performance in the final game and they batted well to get across the line. He adds that the credit should be given to the bowlers as they have had a really hard tour but to perform with this confidence and to execute their plans in this game is commendable. He also adds that the team is improving and they are sometimes slow off the blocks but the team is getting better as the games come thick and fast for them. He closes by saying that good luck to them in picking the team for the Test match as it's been a while since they played their last Test game and everyone is excited.!Taskin Ahmed is awarded the Player of the Series for his 8 wickets. He says that he wanted to believe in himself even if the wicket was flat and wanted to stick to his plans. Adds that in the last few years, they have been working hard, and from that, they have built the belief to try and become one of the most dangerous bowling attacks in the world.!Shakib Al Hasan the captain of Bangladesh says that the batters did not bat well and they will continue with the same attacking approach in the future also as this is what the team is looking forward to going ahead to become a successful team all around the globe. He adds that the team will be traveling back to Dhaka and are looking forward to performing well in the Test match as well. He also adds that they played the same way they did in the first two games but credit to Ireland as they outplayed them.!Time for the presentations...!Ireland came out to bat with intent as they looked to overcome the target in a hurry but they lost Lorcan Tucker and Ross Adair early. Paul Stirling continued to attack and scored a wonderful 77 in just 41 balls to make this run chase a walk in the park. He put together a 68-run partnership for the third wicket with Harry Tector to get his team close to the target before he was dismissed. Curtis Campher added the finishing touches but most of the credit has to go to the bowlers. Six bowlers were used and they all picked up at least a wicket with Mark Adair the pick of the bowlers claiming three and conceding 25 runs. Shamim Hossain put up a fight and got to his half-century but his effort was in vain.!This is a historic win for Ireland as they pick up their first win against Bangladesh away from home! In fact, this is the first time that they have beaten an Asian team in the subcontinent in their history and they have done it in a comprehensive fashion! They may have lost the series but this win will definitely give the Irish ample confidence going into the on-off Test match. Bangladesh seemed to be a bit too confident coming into this game and did not put enough on the board for the bowlers to defend. Taskin Ahmed, Shoriful Islam, and Rishad Hossain claimed one wicket each but could not restrict the scoring as they lost with 6 overs to spare.13.66Taskin Ahmed to Curtis CampherSIX!
