Ilyas dragged a delivery way down the leg-side and the unfortunate batter, Zain Abbas, fell for the pie-ball. While Ilyas' delivery was threatening to land outside the tramline, Abbas had a one-handed poke at it and got a top edge, which fled straight to the keeper, who made no mistake and grabbed the delivery.The video of the incident has been doing rounds on social media. Reacting to the same, New Zealand all-rounder Jimmy Neesham reacted to the video by saying: "Legitimately could be the worst ball in cricket history to ever get a wicket.
