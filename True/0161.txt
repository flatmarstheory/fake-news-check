From Anushka Sharma to Sonam Kapoor,  the who's who of Bollywood, business and fashion made a beeline to the event. Well, our eyes were glued to Isha Ambani and Radhika Merchant. They are sister-in-laws to-be as Radhika is engaged to Isha's brother Anant Ambani. They stayed true to the phrase “less is more”. Isha picked an easy breezy number for the evening. The lemon yellow floral work screamed summer vibes from miles away. For makeup, Isha opted for the minimalistic route. Radhika Merchant picked a white midi dress for the evening. The neck pattern and pleated work added a Victorian edge to the look. Radhika's hair was secured in a neat pony. Their million-dollar smiles did the rest of the job. Isha and Radhika were seen carrying matching alligator skin Lady Dior bags.Radhika Merchant, for her engagement day, picked the colour gold. She exuded grace and beauty in a custom-made Abu Jani Sandeep Khosla lehenga set. The gold silk tissue ghagra featured the finest zardozi work. The hand-embroidery was done using gold zari, crystals and resham. A handmade naqshi border adds to its beauty. The fully hand-embroidered nude silk tulle blouse and dupatta complemented the look. The statement diamond necklace sealed the look. Radhika kept her hair partly open and adorned it with matching accessories. Her makeup, as usual, was on point. (Also Read: Radhika Merchant's Blush Pink Ruffled Saree Came With A Matching Hermes Mini Kelly Bag)

The custom-made resham lehenga featured multi-colour floral booties all over. The mirror patches elevated the look. The blouse was in a similar shade and carried an elaborate floral design. The dupatta offered a slightly different approach. It came with heavy borders and tiny floral work in a zig-zag format. The statement kundan accessories broke the monotony of the look. The touch of emerald made the jewellery stand out. Radhika's braided hairstyle looked perfect. She didn't go overboard with the makeup and we think it went well. View this post on InstagramA post shared by Abu Jani Sandeep Khosla (@abujanisandeepkhosla)ADVERTISEMENTSo what do you have to say about Radhika Merchant's fashion picks?
