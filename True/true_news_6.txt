The distributive politics of urban slums is a dynamic process, where a bottom-up mobilisation seeks to gain material benefits. This goes against the conventional understanding of Indian slums, that “these neighbourhoods are often understood to be governed by ruthless gangs, or rendered the playthings of politicians, who dangle handouts during elections to amass support from desperate residents.”

Against this understanding, the book titled Migrants and Machine Politics: How India’s Urban Poor Seek Representation and Responsiveness authored by Adam Michael Auerbach and Tariq Thachil formulates: “Against these narratives, we find slums communities engaging in sustained, bottom-up claim making to improve local conditions. They actively select their informal leaders through deliberate meetings, informal elections, and day-to-day decisions over whom to follow and whose door to knock on to ask for help.”

This book is the culmination of eight years of research in the slums of two cities, Jaipur and Bhopal.

Migrants and Machine Politics: How India’s Urban Poor Seek Representation and Responsiveness
Princeton University Press (January 2023)

Before I proceed with the review, a caveat. Words used to describe people in the slums and their connections with the political parties and leaders is alien to the vocabulary that we normally find being used in India.

Take for example, client, broker, and patron are words used for a slum dweller, slum representative/leader, and political leader (ward councillor or higher up), respectively. Likewise, machine politics is the politics of slums, which sounds like a mechanical process built into the governance structure. For the sake of convenience, I will use the same words though I do not subscribe to this vocabulary.

Phenomenal exercise

This book is a phenomenal exercise based on research on primary data collected from these two cities. A total of 110 slums were surveyed; 663 party workers (brokers), who held distinct positions within a committee at one of the party organisational levels, were interviewed; 343 party patrons; and over 4,000 respondents/slum residents. The survey and research work was conducted from 2012 to 2020.

The book provokes an interesting discussion on slums. How is political authority crafted within the growing cities? How, if at all, do urban residents have a say in who leads their local community? Once local leaders have taken on this role, how do they decide whom to help in the neighbourhoods where resources are limited? What guides the flow of resources? What are the relations between the brokers and the patrons?

Let us try to explore some of these questions as generated through the research data.

How does the political authority of an individual emerge in a slum? Is it rooted in ethnicity, caste, region or something else? There is interesting data which reveals that the slum dwellers chose their first priority on the basis of the education of the leader and someone who can represent them and connect them to the bureaucracy. The findings exhibit that residents in slums will not simply assemble behind members of their own ethnic group, as is commonly assumed. Residents greatly value brokers whom they see as well-positioned to effectively solve their everyday problems.

Five key features emerge from the research work as laid out in the book. There is persistent underdevelopment in the slums that leads to low-income voters making claims; sending resident requests to local brokers rather than high-level politicians; prioritising effective problem solvers over solely ethnic considerations by residents; brokers privilege building inclusive reputations over monitoring and punishing voters; and the pervasive political competition across and within party organisational networks.

What does this mean?

First, based on the research, local brokerage network formation is crucial for bottom-up demands in the slums. These demands primarily concern the physical infrastructure, sewage management, paving of roads, etc. This sort of citizen agency is critically important to meet the persistent conditions of underdevelopment in the slums.

Second, the requests or demands compel the residents to seek assistance from local political actors, who then relay these demands to higher-level elites, mainly bureaucrats and politicians. This is an another interesting feature of this study. “Such mediated access to political elites is a key organisational feature of machine politics.” Instead of elite politicians, the citizens seek assistance from politically connected leaders. Only 1.5% of the residents said that they would approach MPs for assistance and just 8.3% would approach the MLAs, according to another study (APU-Lokniti), mentioned in the book.

Third, and this one is quite a revelation. The slum residents prioritise effective problem-solvers when seeking assistance, and they do not ‘reflexively’ support members of their own castes. “Education was in the top two responses in both the surveys (Jaipur and Bhopal), while shared ethnicity was not.”

Four, brokers privilege building inclusive reputations over monitoring and punishing voters. An interesting manifestation is the how brokers display indifference to ethnicity, in cultivating multi-ethnic clientele. One of the plausible reasons for this could be the tremendous social diversity observed in Indian slums.

Five, the book highlights how these processes of selection are ‘undergirded’ by considerable political competition at every level of machine politics. Voters often change which party they support. Brokers are willing to flip parties. Patrons are in search of upward mobility and even party elites switching partisan allegiances.

No wonder that a 2019 election survey of national elections found that over 60% of respondents did not report feeling close to any single party.

The major upshot of the study is that the urban poor are thus architects of the political networks that connect them to the state. Politicians have little choice but to engage with slum leaders chosen by residents. And, during the allocation of party positions, they need to prioritise those slum leaders with attributes that will ensure their continued popularity among residents.

The most important attribute is the one that boosts efficacy in problem-solving, i.e., a slum leader’s education.

Is that so simple? 

I find the authors think of ‘slums’ as an ecosystem fully contained within themselves, with little connection with the outside world. But that is not true. The belief that slum residents are the driving force in today’s world of distributive politics would be naïve. The book does not explore the various aspects of the new form of urbanisation taking place since the 1990s. Though there are references to informality, how this informality links to peoples’ lives is hardly ventured into.

Further, the binary between slums and the patron elite is not as unambiguous as it appears to be. It is quite blurred. Take for example, a slum leader who becomes the mayor of the city! Likewise, the role of organised movements or unions is not taken into consideration, even if this is not always visible. Does it create any new architecture or is it meaningless for slum residents?

Threat of majoritarian politics in Indian cities 

However, the epilogue in the book very correctly points out the transition of local politics into a centralising democracy. With the advent of Hindutva politics, the sheer diversity prevalent in slums is also getting marginalised. It rightly points out that “a constant drum beat of Hindutva politics might fundamentally alter realities of ethnic diversity in slums. It may become increasingly difficult for slum leaders and politicians to credibly commit to assisting those of a different faith. …..India’s cities already face systematic marginalisation in the distribution of public services. The breakdown of multi-religious segregation in political networks corrodes a buffer against communal conflict.”

For the Indian cities what is being witnessed is a) greater political and fiscal centralisation and b) unleashed Hindu majoritarianism and growing intolerance of dissent against the Modi government.

Contentious politics is being altered, which is a bedrock for distributive politics!

Do you earn up to Rs 7 lakh? You might still be better off under the old tax regime
Vivek Kaul breaks down the tax benefits and risks of the first ‘Amrit Kaal’ budget.

Do you earn up to Rs 7 lakh? You might still be better off under the old tax regime
Shambhavi Thakur

One thing that comes out clearly from the union budget presented earlier today is that the government wants income tax filers to abandon the old tax regime and move on to the new one.

In fact, currently, those with an income of up to Rs 5 lakh do not pay an income tax when it comes to the old tax regime or for that matter the new one. A rebate is available under both the regimes. 

Nonetheless, come April 2023, those with an income of up to Rs 7 lakh won’t be paying any income tax, as long as they are followers of the new tax regime and not the old one. The rebate in the new tax regime has been increased from Rs 5 lakh to Rs 7 lakh. It stays at Rs 5 lakh under the old regime.

Hence, for anyone with an annual income of up to Rs 7 lakh, it makes sense to file their income tax return under the new tax regime. This seems like a no-brainer. The trouble is that once you have moved on to the new regime you cannot easily go back to the old one. (The only exception is in case of salaried income). 

The old regime comes with its set of exemptions and deductions which aren’t allowed under the new regime. So, an employee cannot deduct their house rent allowance which he or she uses to pay rent on the home they live in, while calculating the taxable income. Other allowances like the leave travel allowance also cannot be deducted while calculating taxable income.

Further, in the case of the old tax regime, any interest paid on a home loan(s) up to a limit of Rs 2 lakh per year can be deducted while calculating taxable income. Also, under the old tax regime, any tax-saving investment under Section 80C (everything from the tax saving mutual funds to insurance premiums to tax saving fixed deposits to public provident fund, and so on), can be deducted while calculating taxable income. This is not allowed under the new tax regime. 

So, while an individual earning up to Rs 7 lakh may seem to be better placed under the new tax regime, nonetheless, the question is, if they are on the old tax regime, should they move on to the new one? This is where things get tricky.

For someone whose income continues to stay up to Rs 7 lakh in the years to come, it makes immense sense to move to the new tax regime, assuming they are on the old one. 

Of course, there is no way of knowing this in advance. But for people who expect to progress in life and hope that their income will be greater than the Rs 7 lakh in the years to come, it might still make sense to continue to remain in the old tax regime in order to make use of all the exemptions and deductions that are available under it as and when their income crosses Rs 7 lakh.

Indeed, the definite answer will vary from person to person and will depend on their saving habits (to make use of tax saving exemptions under Section 80 C) as well as how their salary is structured. For a salary which is high on allowances and which is likely to remain high on allowances in the years to come as an individual progresses, it still might make sense to continue being on the old tax regime, despite the current income being lower than or up to Rs 7 lakh.

However, this comes at a cost, given that those who earn up to Rs 7 lakh and continue to be on the old tax regime, will end up paying some income tax, but that will be the price paid for ensuring that the deductions and exemptions are available to them as and when their income crosses Rs 7 lakh per year. What makes the situation trickier is the fact the tax slabs in the new tax regime have been made more attractive than the old regime.

Let’s consider someone who has an income of Rs 8 lakh a year with a house rent allowance (HRA) of Rs 1,25,000, which he or she is able to completely deduct while calculating taxable income. Over and above this, tax-saving investments of Rs 50,000 are made under Section 80C. Further, Rs 25,000 of leave travel allowance (LTA) is also deducted while calculating taxable income. This implies that the taxable income in this case is Rs 6 lakh (Rs 8 lakh minus Rs 1.25 lakh of HRA minus Rs 50,000 of investments minus Rs 25,000 of LTA). The tax on this works out to Rs 32,500 (without considering any cess) under the old tax regime.

In the new tax regime in 2023-24, the tax on an income of Rs 8 lakh will work out to Rs 35,000. The individual is clearly better placed under the old tax regime. Of course this is not something that can be generalised and really depends on saving habits and the salary structure. Nonetheless, people can make basic calculations before deciding to move from the old regime to the new one. On the flip side, the new tax regime offers simplicity.

To conclude, even those whose income is up to Rs 7 lakh should think before they move on from the old tax regime to the new one. The situation is not as simple as it is being made out to be. Of course, in the years to come, given the government’s push towards the new tax regime, it might decide to dump the old tax regime and totally move to the new one. But that’s a risk worth taking.

‘Jammu is the route, Kashmir the destination’: Bharat Jodo Yatra may have missed a trick in Jammu
Rahul Gandhi’s messaging is on track, but the local Congress needed to have further mobilised the public.

‘Jammu is the route, Kashmir the destination’: Bharat Jodo Yatra may have missed a trick in Jammu
Kartik Kakar

From the Pathankot highway on the outskirts of Jammu, the sight of shipping containers and floodlights suggests you’re looking at an industrial complex. Peer a little closer, though, and you realise you’re looking at a camp of enthusiastic Congress workers who have walked 128 days to get here.

This is the Congress’s Bharat Jodo Yatra, finally in Jammu in the last leg of its journey. The four and a half month march will end with Congress leader Rahul Gandhi hoisting the tricolour in Srinagar on January 30. 

At dawn on January 22, participants and sundry supporters began preparing for the day’s march. One side of the highway was cordoned off and young men in white jackets, with the yatra’s branding, warmed up and stretched for the long trek to follow.

The march began at 7 am with Gandhi, dressed in his signature white t-shirt and black trousers, leading the charge. An hour later, the tail end of the procession was populated with stragglers struggling to keep up. 

The marchers were on their way but were there witnesses to their journey? 

The yatra drew large crowds in other states and union territories but in Kathua district, there was only a feeble expression of support after a rousing reception turned sour when a key local mobiliser of the crowd, Choudhary Lal Singh, was snubbed. 

A former Congress leader, Singh joined the Bharatiya Janata Party amid the Modi wave and won his Basohli constituency seat in Kathua district. He also served as a minister in the last elected government before falling out with the BJP. 

Kathua is where an eight-year-old Bakarwali girl was raped and murdered in 2018. A protest here in February 2018 in support of the accused polarised the region and cemented rightwing sentiments. Last week, a Congress spokesperson resigned after Singh, who supported the accused, joined the Bharat Jodo Yatra at Lakhanpur.

So, in Kathua, it was clear that the bulk of marchers comprised security forces, Congress workers and supporters from outside Jammu and Kashmir.

But things turned around as Gandhi marched into Samba within the hour. Rajinder Sharma, a retired principal from Chanori village, stood near the highway, clutching a walking stick for support. A plastic table was set up next to him with a photo of former prime minister Rajiv Gandhi.

Sharma told this reporter that he and a dozen others were in attendance to congratulate Rahul Gandhi on his “return to the soil of his forefathers”. Rahul Gandhi has Kashmiri Pandit ancestry.

“Rahul Gandhi is working hard and he will get the fruits soon,” Sharma said. “He will become the prime minister of India.”

It’s this belief – that Gandhi will, or should, soon hold the reins of the country – that has led to supporters walking with Gandhi since the march began on September 8 last year. Others have stepped in along the way, like Faisal Choudhary who joined the yatra at Delhi’s border.

A farmer from Uttar Pradesh’s Meerut, Choudhary has gained fame as Gandhi’s lookalike, with many along the way mistakenly showering him with petals and greeting him with warm embraces. A third-generation Congress worker, he said he began wearing a white t-shirt and grew his beard to look more like Gandhi.

“I left all my work to come here,” he said. “It’s a big thing for a small farmer like me but I am doing it for the party – the party’s work is like my own work. My income has stopped but it is also important to support the party.”

What has he learned since he joined the yatra? “That there is no hatred among the people of this country,” he said. “It is only among those who watch the TV channels that spread hatred. The yatra is awakening people to this reality.”

Talk of the town

The Bharat Jodo Yatra is a major political event in Jammu and Kashmir amid the central government’s repressive control over the region. Gandhi and other party leaders have repeatedly criticised the bureaucratic administration headed by lieutenant governor Manoj Sinha as being indifferent to the plight of the people.

Addressing his supporters near Jammu city on January 23, Gandhi said, “In Jammu, the people of Jammu would do business. Jammu and Kashmir was run by the people of Jammu and Kashmir. Today, outsiders are running Jammu and Kashmir. The administration doesn’t pay heed to our rights and voices.”

He also expressed his “surprise” at how Sinha treated a delegation of protesting Kashmiri Pandits, who were displaced from the valley in the 1990s by the militancy and are now facing targeted attacks by militants.

“The LG told a delegation of Kashmiri Pandits ‘you should not beg’. They are not begging, they are demanding their rights,” he said. “If you want to do something, you should apologise to them.”

He made no mention of the 2019 abrogation of Article 370. However, he said he and his party would “use its full strength” to restore statehood to the erstwhile state.

Gandhi’s presence in the region and his opposition to the governing BJP has given new hope to young party workers. “Everyone has been intimidated by the BJP. They are a government of hooliganism,” said Usman Bagwan, a Youth Congress leader from Kishtwar. “The yatra has charged the youth with a newfound passion.”

Bagwan travelled over 200 km to be part of the yatra. “The BJP is imposing new black laws on the people every day,” he said. “Article 370 was removed. It was a black day for us. We were lathi-charged and detained. But we won’t bow down. We love our country and want to live together. We are just waiting for the arrival of our leader.”

These sentiments were echoed by Javed Lone, the party’s district president in Bhaderwah. “The passion with which he is walking, people are joining, rising above faith and class,” he said of Gandhi. “We should take a lesson that if a towering personality like Rahul Gandhi is walking on foot for 3,500 km, nobody can stop us from walking in our booths and blocks. We will walk and strengthen the party at the grassroots.”

Moreover, Lone said Gandhi has disproved critics who once called him names. “The image he has been associated with – he has proved he is not what you call him...Activism will be recharged and all political parties will soon be seen on the ground. The pressure will automatically mount on the LG administration to restart the political process.”

As of January 23, the yatra is in Jammu district and is expected to cover Banihal, the gateway to Kashmir, on Republic Day. There, district president Imad Wani is impatiently waiting for the procession to arrive.

“There have been political activities going on but nothing big of this sort,” he told this reporter over the phone, adding that the Congress has mobilised all volunteers in the district while also receiving support from other regional parties.

On Gandhi, Wani said, “If the next prime minister is himself walking and coming to the people to talk to them, to understand their problems, then youth leaders of the party can learn a big lesson. We have to go to people in our constituencies and blocks to speak to them about their problems.”

Wani said the yatra has not only renewed vigour among party workers, particularly the youth, but has also given hope to the people of Jammu and Kashmir. “By telling the people that a powerful person is with them, he is the nation’s voice and the common person’s voice,” he said. “It is giving us hope.”

Lost opportunities

But all is not as promising as this sounds. Despite simmering resentment against the BJP here, the Congress still failed to ensure broader participation in the yatra. Gandhi voiced the region’s main issues – unemployment, lack of statehood, fresh eviction orders – but local party functionaries dropped the ball in mobilising the public.

“Whatever the potential on the ground, the Congress lacks the organisation to execute this,” said an analyst on condition of anonymity. “The moment the yatra crossed Lakhanpur, the local organising capacity had little result on the ground.” Until January 19, he said, the local BJP had been nervous. But no longer, because “there were more people participating from Punjab and Kashmir than locals of Jammu”.

He blamed it on two factors: complacency by the J&K Congress and mishandling of Choudhary Lal Singh as the yatra entered J&K. Lal Singh was not allowed on stage with Gandhi and other regional leaders. Other prominent Congress leaders had left the party to side with Ghulam Nabi Azad, he said, and Lal Singh – now unpopular due to his support of the Kathua rapists – “is the only regional force against the BJP”.

The analyst also pointed at nepotism within the Congress. Leaders like Yogesh Sahni and Raman Bhalla “used the yatra to launch their sons into politics. The efforts they made to ensure their children walked with Rahul Gandhi and that it was covered by the local press – it would have been more effective to get popular local intellectuals and writers and other celebrities.”

The analyst also cited “intimidation” by the BJP. “The BJP created a very aggressive environment to send out the message that it’s not fair if you participate in the Bharat Jodo Yatra,” he said. “Local people don’t want to be seen walking with the yatra because they fear reprisals.” 

Several BJP leaders in Jammu and Kashmir – such as Ravinder Raina, Devendra Rana, and union minister of state Jitendra Singh – had criticised the yatra. Rana called the Congress the “B-Team” of the People's Alliance for Gupkar Declaration, a regional political alliance that his party has derided as the “Gupkar gang”. 

The analyst compared the yatra to the runup to the 2019 Lok Sabha poll, when Gandhi launched the “chowkidar chor hai” campaign against the BJP. “The number of people angry with the BJP doesn’t necessarily mean they are seeking the Congress. They don’t believe the Congress can be a refuge,” he said. “If the Congress has to take votes, it has to be from Jammu. But their hopes are pinned on Kashmir where they don’t have a vote bank.”

And therein lies the heart of the issue, he said, that the Congress views Jammu merely as a “route” while Kashmir is its “destination”.

Tarun Upadhyay, a senior journalist based in Jammu, said it’s evident the yatra missed a strong current, but that’s also because the Congress has been out of power for a long time, and its future is uncertain.

“But this doesn’t mean we can rule out the undercurrent,” he said, adding that Jammu has traditionally been a Congress bastion. “It can re-emerge anytime.” 

On Gandhi, Upadhyay said there’s been a “shedding of his princeling image, with him showing people he is one among them”. Gandhi also struck a chord with Jammu by raising critical issues of retrieval of stateland, statehood, and trade – the backbone of Jammu’s economy – being overtaken by outsiders.

“A pan-India party making a Jammu-centric statement does connect with the Jammu region,” he said, “but it's the job of the ground worker to amplify that.”

He added that there’s a growing realisation in Jammu that the LG doesn’t even listen to the local BJP and that outsiders are calling the shots. So, contesting this would strike a chord with the public.

“Even if their government is formed, it will still be controlled by outsiders. People are already saying Jammu is becoming like UP and Bihar, which people won’t accept,” he said. “We don’t want a model of UP and Bihar and people from there calling the shots here.”
