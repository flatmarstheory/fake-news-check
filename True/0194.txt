We arrive at the office with verve and vigour, only to feel our energy levels slump after lunchtime. We then drag ourselves through the rest of the day, dreaming of our cosy bed at home, and later regret wasting half of our day while brooding over lost productivity. But why does this happen every other day? You can pin it down to the heavy meal you ate for lunch. However, if food is the problem, then food is also the solution. Let's delve deeper into it.Also Read: Top Four Foods to Stay Alert at WorkWhy Do We Get Sleepy and Tired After Lunch?When we eat excessively, our body produces high amounts of insulin to regulate blood sugar levels. Our body also produces sleep hormones that get converted into serotonin and melatonin in our brain, leading to increased sleepiness and decreased productivity.Not eating is not an option, especially at work. But eating right is the only solution to get rid of sluggishness in the afternoon. Follow these tips, and we are sure you'll stay active all day long.Eat healthy foods while workingPhoto Credit: iStockHere are five tips to avoid sleepiness after lunch:1. Control Food PortionsThe heavier the meal, the higher the insulin spike. While it may be tempting to grab bites from your colleagues' lunch boxes while eating your own food, make sure to limit your food intake and don't stuff your stomach. It's better to have another small meal or healthy snack later.2. Avoid Processed FoodsTakeout and deliveries are exciting at work but keep in mind that these foods are mostly made with refined grains and fats, which digest quickly and can cause a spike in blood sugar levels. So, avoid foods with maida and too much fat. A simple homemade meal is the best option.Also Read: How to Knock Off Stubborn Office Fat3. Enjoy FruitsYour sweet tooth may demand sweet treats, but don't give in. Sugar may give you an instant energy boost, but it will go down just as fast, making you feel lazy after some time. The best thing to do is to eat sweet fruits. Keep energy-dense fruits like bananas or any other fruit of your choice with you.4. Chew GumSurprised? Many studies have suggested that chewing gum makes your body and mind more alert as you are in a constant active mode. It can also improve your mood and reduce anxiety. However, pick sugar-free gum to avoid the negative effects, and make sure not to overdo it.5. Drink WaterWe tend to forget to drink enough water in the middle of a hectic day. This leads to dehydration, which causes fatigue, sleepiness, and loss of concentration. So keep yourself hydrated throughout the day to perform better at work.Simple diet changes can help you get rid of sleepiness and increase productivity at work.We tend to forget to drink enough water in the middle of a hectic day.
