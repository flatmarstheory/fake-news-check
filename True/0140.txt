We mostly apply most of our skincare products on this outer layer of the skin which then penetrate to reach the skin cells beneath.Skin cells contain the goodness of keratin (a natural protein) and natural moisturisers that help maintain the hydration content of the skin. The skin barrier also contains fatty acids, cholesterol, and ceramides which help in keeping the skin appear lively and plump.So, if you wish to look young wand have a radiant skin, you need to ensure that your skin barrier is performing well and is not damaged.

Follow the below step to understand which skin type you own.Skin Barrier: Always know your skin type before purchasing skincare products, and then shop accordinglyFirstly, cleanse all the impurities from the face and neck using micellar water or cleansing balm.Then wash off using the mild face cleanser.Pat dry with a soft towel or just let it air dry.Leave the skin bare for about 1 hour:If your skin turns oily, then your skin type is oily/acne-prone.If your skin feels stretched and dehydrated, then you have dry skin type.If your skin does not turn oily or feel dehydrated, then you're blessed with normal skin type.If your T-zone turns greasy and other parts remain normal, then you've combination skin type.If your skin feels irritated or inflamed, then sensitive is your skin type.Identifying your skin type becomes important as it helps you pick the right products that contain the ingredients your skin is craving.Stages To Repair Damaged Skin BarrierBelow you'll find about the repair stages of the skin barrier so that you can fix your skin and so that your skin can absorb all the benefits of skin care products that'll help your skin glow and appear healthy.Repair Damaged Skin Barrier- 1st Stage (2-4 Weeks)Cleanse: Immediately stop your elaborative skincare routine; instead start with the basics. Wash your face with an extremely gentle cleanser at least once a day (ideally PM).Moisturiser: Apply a fragrance-free moisturiser on your skin.Sunscreen: Then top your skin with a broad-spectrum sunscreen (do this in the AM). It will help protect the skin from UV rays and harmful radiation which will also inhibit further damage and keep the skin barrier protected.Facial Oil: Incorporate a facial oil as the last product for your PM routine. Facial oils can help improve fatty acids that can contribute to the strengthening of the skin barrier.Improve Diet: Include omega-rich and fibrous foods in your diet.Hydrate Your Body: Drink lots of water and eat lots of fruits and veggies.

Avoid toners that contain fragrance or alcohol.Serum: Slip the concentrated formula into your skincare regime that contains niacinamide, ceramides, panthenol, cica or peptides. This will help boost skin cell regeneration and contribute to a healthy skin barrier.Moisturiser: Pick a suitable moisturise that contains cholesterol, hyaluronic acid, ceramides, panthenol, cica, peptides or fatty acids. This will help rebuild the strength of the skin barrier and restore the natural sheen of the skin.Sunscreen: Do not forget to apply broad-spectrum sunscreen that suits your skin type the best. This will shield the skin barrier and prevent damages.How To Protect Your Skin Barrier From DamageRemember these two words: Gentle and Patience. Chant these two words daily and practice the same if you want your skin barrier to be perfect.Start with a lower percentage of acids/actives in your regime and then gradually build up as your skin gets used to it as it will help perform better and prevent breakouts.CTM shouldn't be compromised, especially the night skincare regime.Don't take sunscreen for granted and make it a regular practice so your skin remains protected from harmful rays and other environmental damages.Do not over-exfoliate. Regulate your exfoliation process with the skin type you have.Don't go overboard with beauty products and invest in the right ingredients that are required for your skin type.Look for anti-oxidants in your beauty products this will minimise any incoming stressors.Keep stress at bay.Practice a healthy lifestyle that includes a well-balanced diet and optimum hydration.Time To Shop The Essentials To Repair Skin BarrierMild Face CleanserMild cleaners are made of gentle ingredients that do not strip off the natural oil of the skin.
