In 'Selective' Demolition, Muslim Structures Razed But Temple Spared in Gujarat's Dwarka
The Gujarat coastline has seen multiple demolition drives in recent months. Opposition parties and locals allege that the administration is making it a point to displace Muslims and disrupt their livelihoods.

New Delhi/Dwarka: On March 28, Gujarat chief minister Bhupendra Patel visited Porbandar’s Harsiddhi Temple with the state’s home minister, Harsh Sanghavi. In October 2022, the same coastal city of Porbandar saw a massive demolition drive which set out to raze ‘unauthorised structures’ – under the banner of which the district administration demolished the Muradsha Pir Dargah.

Following this demolition, local Muslims protested. Prohibitory orders were issued in the jurisdiction of four police stations in Porbandar after the police used tear gas to prevent Muslims from marching to a site in the Udyognagar area where an ‘unauthorised’ religious structure was razed.

On Gujarat’s coast, demolitions made a comeback when on March 12 this year, villages across Devbhumi Dwarka district saw drives to expel ‘illegal occupants’ from the district.

More than 200 structures have been razed so far at the Gandhvi fishing harbour near the Harsiddhi temple – these include homes, mosques, Islamic shrines and shops owned by locals. A majority of the population in Gandhvi is Muslim and practice fishing as their livelihood.

The Dwarka administration has maintained that the unauthorised structures which now stand demolished were built on government land, the Harshad Harbour in the Mendha creek near the Harsiddhi Temple. The administration also added that the properties and warehouses located along the seacoast could be used as a landing point for smuggled drugs.

Mosques razed, temple spared

Gafur Daud Patel, a local from Harshad, has had to pack all his belongings from his 35-year-old home overnight. From Harshad harbour, his family of eight fled to Gir Somnath district after the government issued a 24-hour demolition warning.

“Muslims were fleeing, packing their things in a rush, piling their belonging on their heads and trying to make sense of what was happening. But the Shankar Temple near our demolished homes was left untouched,” alleged Patel.

Imam Sharfuddin, a cleric from the village, told The Wire that no mercy was shown to Islamic shrines and structures in the village. “Our Dargah Ghaus Paaq, our Madina mosque were demolished in one go,” he said.

Locals have alleged that the Shankar Temple in Harshad had also received the notice declaring it as an illegal structure and yet it was spared.

Community leader Haji Hanif explained that the village now wore a deserted look and nothing except the temple survived. “We are being targeted in the garb of security and drug peddling; how can an entire village be emptied due to the government’s suspicion?” he asked.

Though the government had served them notices in January asking them to vacate the premises because it wanted to demolish them, at least 69 fishermen of Gandhvi and 122 from 20 km away, Navadra, had petitioned the high court seeking regularisation of their homes constructed on the government land.

Fishermen ousted for capitalists’ settlements

The demolitions, allegations of drug peddling, and concerns for national security create an environment of hostility for those fleeing the affected villages. Congress’s Nusrat Panja views the targeted ouster of Muslims as nowhere related to any of the concerns expressed by the government.

“Hindus also live in settlements across the coast, their villages can also pose as a potential avenue for the dangers highlighted by the government. But you do not see them being pushed to homelessness. Veraval is one such village,” Panja said.

Panja also added that if the government found these locals to be residing on illegally occupied land, they should have been rehabilitated first and then their illegal homes could have been brought down. “These fishermen have been living here for decades and generations, how can the administration uproot them without offering alternate housing facilities?” he asked.

On March 28, chief minister Patel and state home minister Sanghavi took stock of the demolition of illegal structures carried out in Bet Dwarka in Devbhumi Dwarka district. With most Muslim fishermen displaced, the chief minister asserted that no illegal construction will be allowed along the coastal belt and the campaign against illegal encroachments will continue.

With hundreds of structures reduced to rubble, Mujahid Nafees, convenor, Minority Coordination Committee, Gujarat understands this as a two-pronged attack on the fishermen. “For one, the administration is trying to clear the coast of these fishermen in the garb of national security, only to hand this coast to capitalists, and secondly, they want to further the fake narrative that it is Muslims who indulge in all kinds of illegalities, be it settling illegally or drug peddling as the government alleges,” Nafees said.

Nafees also added that the Muslim fishermen whom the government is trying to remove from the coastline are actually the first line of defence in case of any intrusion or suspicious activity along the coast. Yet they were being painted as criminals.

“Musalmaan ka makaan, masjid, madarsa, mazaar, sab gira dia, magar mandir waheen hai abhi bhi,” said Nafees, referring to the fact that while the temples have received notices to vacate the premises, but they have neither been forcefully evicted nor the premises demolished.

Demolition and drugs

Congress’s V.T. Sida from Junagadh has been working to get the expelled fishermen into rehabilitation camps. Sida, who personally met with chief minister Patel, said that he was assured that the government would investigate the matter. But he says assurances are not enough to house those who have lost their livelihoods and places of living.

Sida explained, “If the government feels that drug peddling is happening, they have ample amount of intelligence to nab the culprits, why kick out the Muslim fishermen in this manner? If their residence is illegal, they should be shifted to rehabilitation camps, why is the government making it look like it is freeing an area from Muslim occupation?”

This is the second major demolition drive along the Devbhumi Dwarka coast in about three months. The previous demolition happened merely months before the state’s assembly elections. In October 2022, the government undertook a massive demolition drive razing at least a hundred structures in Bet Dwarka, an island off the Okha coast, famous for the Dwarkadhish Mukhya Mandir, a shrine for the Hindu deity Krishna. Currently,  120 structures in Navadra, 80 structures in Harshad, 65 structures in Bhogat and 120 structures in Bet Dwarka sit broken. This tally is inclusive of the four broken mosques and four toppled dargahs in all the four villages.

Gafur Daud Patel, one of the petitioners, told The Wire that the high court disposed of the matter after the government assured the court that the affected families will be rehabilitated according to existing policies of the government, paving the way for the demolition. Yet, many like Patel from the coast’s emptied villages have fled fearing being flattened under the rubble that their decades-old houses have been turned into.

The Wire has reached out to superintendent of police, Dwarka Nitesh Pandey to ask about the allegation that Muslims were being selectively targeted through the demolitions. This article will be updated if he responds.

Tamil Nadu’s ‘attacks’ on migrants: The anatomy of a rumour
And what the BJP hoped to gain – but didn’t.

Tamil Nadu’s ‘attacks’ on migrants: The anatomy of a rumour
Shambhavi Thakur
whatsapp

A friend sends a text message: “My mother’s really worried about the murders of Bihari workers in Tamil Nadu, she saw some videos on WhatsApp.”

A journalist posts on a private social media group: “Can someone verify whether workers from the Northeast are at risk in Tamil Nadu too? I got a video warning them.”

Someone’s parent says bitterly: “This is what happens under these governments that hate North Indians.”

In the wondrous times of the internet, it takes zero effort for a lie to become the truth. That’s how it played out in Tamil Nadu last week. 

Videos of events were passed off as North Indian migrants being “attacked” in the state. For instance, one video was of two men stabbing a lawyer in Rajasthan, another showed a man being murdered in Telangana. A third was of a murder in Karnataka, and a fourth of a Tamil man hacked to death in Coimbatore.

In all these cases, the captions on social media indicated that these were “attacks” on Hindi-speaking migrants in Tamil Nadu. 

In the textile town of Tirupur, a migrant worker’s body was found on the train tracks, leading to hundreds of workers congregating in protest. The police had to release CCTV footage – showing the man walking along the tracks and being hit by a train – to prove this wasn’t a case of “murder”.

Sections of the media contributed to the chaos. Dainik Bhaskar was arguably the trigger for widespread reportage on these purported attacks, alleging at least 12 “murders”. The stories were quickly picked up by C-grade enterprises like OpIndia which alleged “Talibani style attacks” on migrant workers.

Meanwhile, fact-checkers, journalists, industrialists and representatives from the police and government worked overtime to clarify that all was well.

While much has been written and analysed about the nature of these falsehoods, what’s interesting is the reaction of the BJP.

Different strokes

In Bihar, the party tweeted that workers had been “killed” and attacked the RJD-JDU government for not acting. In the assembly, BJP MLAs demanded chief minister Nitish Kumar’s resignation and criticised deputy chief minister Tejashwi Yadav for “eating cake” while his Bihari brethren were dying.

For context, Yadav had on March 1 attended a programme in Chennai on the occasion of chief minister MK Stalin’s 70th birthday. Alongside Akhilesh Yadav of the Samajwadi Party, Farooq Abdullah of the National Conference, and Mallikarjun Kharge of the Congress, they pledged to take on the BJP in 2024.

Fact-finding teams from Bihar and Jharkhand later visited Tamil Nadu to meet with officials and workers.

Next, in Uttar Pradesh, BJP spokesperson Prashant Patel Umrao tweeted a photo of Yadav with Stalin and alleged 12 Bihari workers in Tamil Nadu had been “hanged to death”. He was booked in Tamil Nadu for fake news. Umrao approached the Delhi High Court saying he had fallen prey to fake news and was granted transit anticipatory bail for 10 days.

But in Tamil Nadu, the BJP took a completely different tack.

MLA Vanathi Srinivasan accused a “few organisations of sowing hatred” and urged the DMK government to book those responsible under the National Security Act.

On his part, BJP chief K Annamalai said “fake news” about migrant workers was being spread and that it was the DMK’s fault for creating a “divide”. After all, didn’t Stalin’s son Udhayanidhi once wear a t-shirt saying Hindi Teriyadhu Poda while Stalin’s sister Kanimozhi grumbled about airport security speaking to her in Hindi?

“They were the ones who started the venomous campaign, against North Indians,” he wrote on social media, “and it makes us think that they could be the reasons for the current rumours against the guest workers.” He was promptly booked for promoting enmity and disharmony.

Annamalai’s approach isn’t surprising. The BJP in Tamil Nadu walks a line that’s often forced to deviate from the national one. It defends Tamil identity and describes itself as being “allergic” to Hindi imposition. Its only major ally, the AIADMK, has panned the BJP’s pet projects like NEET and the Citizenship Amendment Act. The BJP was also caught between the AIADMK’s splitting into two in the battle between E Palaniswami and O Panneerselvam, finally throwing its weight behind EPS.

And Annamalai has his own internal woes to deal with. 

Internal strife

Two days ago, BJP state IT cell president CTR Nirmal Kumar resigned, saying the state leadership conducts “surveillance” on functionaries, works against party interests, and uses the party for “commercial means”. He then joined the AIADMK.

A day later, IT cell secretary Dilip Kannan also quit. Like Nirmal, he squarely blamed Annamalai for leaving and then joined the AIADMK.

Annamalai then lashed out at his alliance partner for accepting the BJP’s former members. “If I go shopping,” he told India Today, “my shopping list will be big.”

Months before, another rift had unfolded within the party over an audio leak of a conversation between two party members – OBC Morcha state general secretary Surya Siva and minority wing leader Daisy Saran. The state BJP suspended them for a period of six months. 

It also suspended actor Gayathri Raghuram, who had joined the party in 2014, after she slammed Surya on Twitter and said it was a mistake to give a state post to “such hyenas”. She then quit the BJP in January, saying “women are not safe” under Annamalai. She called him a “cheap tactic liar and adharmic leader”, and said she was “ready to raise a police complaint”.

Annamalai, a former IPS officer, had joined the party in 2020. He contested in the assembly election in May 2021 from Aravakurichi but lost. Two months later, he was appointed the president of the BJP Tamil Nadu after former chief L Murugan was sworn in as a minister of state in the Lok Sabha. He was only 37 years old at the time and perhaps the idea was to project him as the true “youth leader”, a sobriquet once held by MK Stalin.

After all, the BJP’s inroads in Tamil Nadu have been slow going. 

In the 2019 Lok Sabha poll, The BJP lost its only seat in Kanyakumari and its vote share fell from 2014’s 5.56 percent to 3.66 percent. In the 2021 assembly poll, it won four seats and entered the legislative assembly for the first time since 2001, albeit in an alliance with the AIADMK, the primary opposition party. It is still a minor party though Delhi media treats it as a key member of the opposition. 

So, the migrant rumours of this week presented Annamalai’s BJP with the opportunity to tackle the DMK government on a particularly thorny issue – conflating the DMK’s “anti Hindi” stand with being “anti North India”. 

In Tamil Nadu, Hindi imposition is an intensely political and personal issue, and has been since the 1930s, when Periyar and the Justice Party led demonstrations against C Rajagopalachari’s Congress government. Former Tamil Nadu chief minister CN Annadurai once criticised the idea that Tamils had to study Hindi for a larger communication with India, reportedly saying: “Do we need a big door for the big dog and a small door for the small dog? I say, let the small dog use the big door too.”

These politics were resurrected under the BJP government in the centre. In October 2022, the Tamil Nadu government adopted a resolution against the central government’s attempts to impose Hindi.  

The BJP had staged a walkout at the time, but perhaps saw the migrant rumours of this week as a way to revive the issue. But instead, with a flurry of clarifications and FIRs, public attention has been drawn to the fact that the entire controversy was engineered.

Not quite the outcome the BJP would hope for.

In Kerala, 'targeting' of Asianet brings CPM’s frayed ties with the media back in focus
Two days after SFI barged into the channel’s office, the crime branch raided its premises.

In Kerala, 'targeting' of Asianet brings CPM’s frayed ties with the media back in focus

In the alleged targeting of Asianet News in Kerala and the CPM leadership’s failure to condemn it, the party and the Pinarayi Vijayan government’s relationship with the media is now back in focus.

On Sunday, the crime branch searched Asianet News Kozhikode office over a complaint from a CPM-backed Independent MLA. This came two days after the Students’ Federation of India, the student wing of the governing party in Kerala, barged into the Malayalam news channel’s Kochi office.

While legislators, political parties, and journalists' unions have condemned the incident and termed it an attack on the media, the CPM’s leadership is silent. Even the party’s general secretary Sitaram Yechury, who had hit out at the Narendra Modi government on the same day the income tax department searched the BBC India’s offices last month. Or his party politburo, which was quick to release a statement on BBC titled “intimidating media”.

The 28-year-old Malayalam channel is owned by union minister Rajeev Chandrasekhar.

But what led to the police search?

Last week, Nilambur Independent MLA PV Anvar had raised questions about a segment aired on November 10 last year on the channel’s show Roving Reporter.

The show, which features in-depth ground reports themed on one issue in each episode, had focussed on synthetic drug abuse among school and college students in Kerala.

The report was by senior correspondent Naufal Bin Yusaf, whose investigative pieces have often irked CPM's cadres in Kannur.

The show on November 10 had come on the heels of an anti-drug campaign across schools endorsed by excise minister MB Rajesh. It alleged that students were deployed as drug mules in the district and many of them were also sexually harassed. 

But the issue was raised in the Kerala assembly only last week by Anvar. Referring to allegations by a minor interviewee, the MLA asked if the matter was examined, a complaint filed or a POCSO case lodged. He also asked if it was correct to not inform the police and go for a media interview.

The chief minister said that “a case has been registered to check the veracity of the story; abuse claims couldn't be verified and POCSO sections can be included in the case”. He said police had probed the case based on a complaint filed by the victim's father, and a report has been submitted in court. He also said that police had to be informed before talking to the media. 

While the chief minister’s response did not affirm that Asianet News report was fake, his answers were tweaked by CPM cadres to attack Naufal and the news channel on social media, calling the interview “staged”. The channel had added an audio clip that was part of a report aired in August to the episode containing several interviews in November for recreation purposes. It did not add a disclaimer mentioning the enactment.

The SFI barged into the channel’s office on Friday, a POCSO case was filed against the channel on Saturday, and crime branch sleuths searched its premises on Sunday in Kozhikode.

But this is not the first time Asianet News or its journalists have come under attack from the CPM or the Pinarayi government.

Frayed relationship

Last month, Vinu V John, an anchor and senior journalist at Asianet News, was summoned by Kerala police over a case filed by the Centre of Indian Trade Unions (CITU) and Rajya Sabha CPM member Elamaram Kareem.

This came nearly a year after CITU and CPM cadres marched to the channel’s headquarters in Thiruvananthapuram to seek John's resignation, a day after he hit out at Kareem on his show in March, 2022. 

After an autorickshaw driver, Yaseer, was injured in an attack by demonstrators during a violent protest by unions in Kerala last year, Kareem sought to downplay the incident and its coverage by the media. “They say someone was scratched and pinched.”

On his show News Hour the same day, John said, “They (unionists) should have vandalised the vehicle in which Elamaram Kareem was traveling. And then the occupants – if he was traveling with his family – should have been de-boarded. The tyres of the vehicle carrying Elamaram Kareem should have been deflated….Kareem, like Yasser, should have been slapped in the face and left bleeding from his nose. Then he would have realised whether it was just scratching, pinching, or insulting.”

The CPM and CITU interpreted John’s comments as a direct call to attack Kareem, and marched to the channel’s office in the state capital in March last year. While everyone believed that things had eventually settled down, John found out that Kareem had filed a police case against him in April without informing him when he went to renew his passport in June last year.

Based on that case, the police summoned him last month.

But it’s not just Asianet

Media professionals in Kerala see Pinarayi Vijayan as a leader with a dislike, or even contempt, for the media. With little shift in this perception after the leader’s appointment as the chief minister.

In 2016, contrary to the practice of holding press conferences after Cabinet meetings, Vijayan dropped interactions with the media and started issuing press releases.

In 2017, when journalists went to cover a “meeting” at a hotel in Thiruvananthapuram, they were ousted as the chief minister yelled “kadakku purath”. Get out. It was a closed-door meeting with RSS leaders reportedly mediated by Yoga practitioner Sri M.

In 2020, the chief minister’s amendment to the Kerala Police Act, aimed at preventing cyberattacks against women, was seen as a bid to curtail media freedom. It sought to introduce a new provision to criminalise defamatory content but was rolled back following outrage by the opposition and civil society.

All this besides certain restrictions on the media from covering proceedings in the Assembly.  

But long before Pinarayi Vijayan was referred to by journalists as “Mundudatha Modi”, meaning “Modi in dhoti”, for his record on press freedom, the leader and the media used to love each other when he was a minister in the EK Nayanar government from 1996 to 1998. 

But as he quit the cabinet and moved to party ranks, allegations popped up about him allegedly receiving kickbacks from a Canadian company. The media began asking tough questions, and Vijayan, gradually, began to hate it.

And during these years, Vijayan and Achuthanandan – who is also a CPM founding member – became rivals in the party. While Achuthanandan knew how to handle the media, Vijayan failed, and gradually morphed into his current Stalinist image. 

Since then, Vijayan is not known to be lenient with the press, except perhaps one occasion in 2016. The CPM leader had called a press conference before a rally ahead of elections. As the media was late, he delayed his press conference for 30 minutes because he wanted the event to go live. But it was only a rare moment when he needed the media more than the media needed him.

Asianet news is the upcoming Republic TV of Kerala. Fake news and unnecessary hype creation over irrelevant issues. As mentioned in the article, the channel owner is a BJP minister, hence the channel upholds the interest of the BJP government and tries to malign the State Government by creating fake news like the case mentioned in the article. The author has tried his best to whitewash the whole incident in favour of Asianet.. great efforts Mr. Rejimon Kuttapan.
