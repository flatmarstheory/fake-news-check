Despite just minor upgrades over the Nord 2 (Review), the new OnePlus Nord 2T 5G seems to have it all. OnePlus' first ‘T' model in the Nord series isn't a brand-new phone, but seems to get the basics right by including a proper mid-range processor, an upgraded fast-charging system, a quality display and a capable primary camera with optical image stabilisation (OIS). Indeed, it seems to have everything one could ask for at a slightly lower starting price of Rs. 28,999.

OnePlus Nord 2T 5G Summary
The OnePlus Nord 2T 5G comes with minor upgrades over the previous model. Its design mostly remains the same as before, but has some minor changes around the back, which includes a new layout for the cameras.
Its processor has been upgraded to a Dimensity 1300 SoC, which brings some performance improvements. The display remains the same as before and offers a 90Hz refresh rate.
The phone offers OxygenOS 12.1 which is based on Android 12. It has minimal bloatware and comes with just one preinstalled third-party app. Software performance is smooth and it all feels fluid thanks to the 90Hz display.
Gaming performance is quite good as well. The phone still lacks a macro camera unlike the original Nord, but the primary camera can shoot decent close-up images. Low-light performance is quite good. Battery capacity remains the same as before, but OnePlus has amped up the charging to 80W.
