Redmi Note 12 Pro+ 5G is Xiaomi's latest mid-range smartphone offering in India. The top-of-the-line phone in theÂ Note 12 series isÂ a direct successor to the Redmi Note 11 Pro+ 5G (Review), whichÂ didn't quite pan out to be a segment leader as many would haveÂ hoped for, in our opinion. Xiaomi is now trying to fill the void with the Redmi Note 12 Pro+ 5G, with some segment-first hardware.

Redmi Note 12 Pro+ 5G Summary
Redmi Note 12 Pro+ 5G has launched in India with a relatively-expensive price tag. The Redmi Note 11 Pro+ 5G successor finds itself in the Xiaomi 11i HyperCharge price category, courtesy of the upgrades on offer.
The phone comes with a glass back and a 120Hz AMOLED display. The 6.67-inch screen is flat and has a hole-punch cutout. Its headlining feature is theÂ 200-megapixel primary camera. The triple-camera setup also features an 8-megapixel ultra-wide camera and a 2-megapixel macro camera.For selfies, there is a 16-megapixel front camera.
The Note 12 Pro+ 5G runs on the Android 12-based MIUI 13, which is a bummer considering rivals are shipping with Android 13.The phone features a MediaTek Dimensity 1080 SoC. It has up to 12GB of RAM and 256GB of storage on offer.
Another HyperCharge feature that the premium Note gets is 120W fast charging support for the 5000mAh battery.
