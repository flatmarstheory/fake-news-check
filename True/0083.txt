While the Hardik Pandya-led GT will look to repeat their heroics from last year, CSK will aim to improve from their ninth-spot finish.Sound üîõ@iamRashmika gets the crowd going with an energetic performance üí•Drop an emoji to describe this special #TATAIPL 2023 opening ceremony üëá pic.twitter.com/EY9yVAnSMN‚Äî IndianPremierLeague (@IPL) March 31, 2023The 2022 season was a memorable one for the Titans as they clinched the title in their debut season thanks to an all-round show from Pandya. The all-rounder led by example and was supported brilliantly by Mohammed Shami, Rashid Khan, David Miller, Rahul Tewatia and Shubman Gill.On the other hand, CSK were off to a horrible start under new skipper Ravindra Jadeja and midway into the season, the 34-year-old decided to step down from his position. Dhoni was once again the choice for captaincy but it was too little too late as CSK could manage only four wins from 14 games.There remains some doubts on Dhoni's availability for the match as the veteran was suffering from a knee injury and time will tell if he will lead CSK in the opening match of this year's competition.Comments Topics mentioned in this articleIPL 2023
