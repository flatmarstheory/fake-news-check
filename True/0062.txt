Karnataka will vote on May 10 to elect a new government and members to its 224-seat assembly and results will be declared on May 13. In all, 58,282 polling booths will be set up in the state's 31 districts. There are 5.14 crore voters, out of which 2.59 crore are male and 2.55 crore are female.
The BJP is in power in Karnataka, led by Chief Minister Basavaraj Bommai. The state is seeing a triangular fight between the BJP, Congress and Janata Dal (Secular), or JD(S), in the assembly election. While both the national parties are going all-out bid to power, the JD(S) is focusing on the regions where it has a strong presence. The BJP's
campaign has been boosted by Prime Minister Narendra Modiâs outreach to voters. Other central BJP leaders have been visiting Karnataka and holding rallies and showing support to local BJP leaders.
Some of the key leaders who will contest the Karnataka assembly election 2023 include Janata Dal (Secular)âs HD Kumaraswamy, BS Yediyurappaâs son BY Vijayendra, Congressâs Siddaramaiah, BJPâs Basavaraj Bommai and Congressâs DK Shivakumar.
Karnataka Chief Electoral Officer Manoj Kumar Meena has been reaching out to voters to provide better services in making the electoral rolls, providing electoral photo identity cards, creating electoral awareness and bringing in transparency in the system.
The knowledge awareness practice survey 2023 was undertaken in Karnataka to understand the reasons for gaps in electoral participation, both at enrolment and in voting. Interesting findings and useful suggestions of the survey have been used to prepare the action plan for the systematic voter education and electoral participation, or SVEEP, the Karnataka Chief Electoral Officer says on its website.
