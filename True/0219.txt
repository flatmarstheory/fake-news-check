What Are The Major Types Of Mixed Media?
Previous articleAcrylic Medium: A Fascinating Blessing To The ArtistsNext articleHow To Make Fine Art Prints At Home
By Team mojarto
Many artists choose to work with mixed media because it allows them to break the boundaries between different art forms and give a whole new dimension to their creativity. There are no limits to what can be achieved by blending these, you can try to add sculpture to your painting, you can create a painting and add swatches of fabric, memorabilia, rocks and so on or paint on top of photographs or print on them.
Collage
Kalapvriskha By Pranati Das
This is a very popular kind of mixed media art. Collage is derived from the French word “coller” which means “to glue.” All you need to do is “stick” material to a surface. The base for this can range from a blank canvas, paper, cardboard, panels of flat wood, or just about anything you can think of. You can paint and stick on different materials on to it, you can use photographs, ribbons, fabric, coloured stones and more.
Assemblage
The blue pond by Amita Soni Dand
An assemblage is similar to collage, the difference is that it incorporates three-dimensional elements, that are combined to create a piece of art that tells a story.
Altered booksHere a book is used as the base, it may be used as a collage or painted on, pages torn out or paper sculptures created out of it.
Sculpture
Pet By Subrata Paul
You might be surprised to find sculptures categorised under mixed media. The reason is that in many cases, artists choose a base material and then use other kinds of material to bring in new elements of colour, shape and pattern.
Installation artAn art installation is a three-dimensional visual artwork that is often constructed for a specific place (in situ) and is intended to alter people’s perceptions of space. It is a type of mixed media art that not only takes into account surroundings but also evokes viewer participation. The goal here is to alter a viewer’s experience of a particular environment which could be a room or public space.
Wet and Dry Media
fireflies by Prittam Priyalochan
This includes working with a wet and dry media to create interesting effects. This might include blending drawing with painting or charcoal drawing mixed with oil-based paints.
