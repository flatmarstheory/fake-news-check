Mobile Phones
The Gadgets 360 mobile phone finder helps you find the smartphone you're looking for - thanks to the many filters we've provided to refine your search. With this tool, you'll be able to find the best mobile phone for your needs, across all major mobile phone brands. Thus, if you're in the market to buy a mobile phone, and unsure which model to spend your hard-earned money on, just choose from filters like price, RAM, clock speed, 5G connectivity, and more, to home in on device best suited to your needs. Gadgets 360 has one of the largest mobile phone databases in the world, and don't forget, apart from our helpful phone finder, you can also compare mobile phones to help you make your buying decision.
Price: We've provided a helpful slider with which you can choose the price range for your search results. You can also enter the starting price and end price figures manually.
Brand: Here, you can filter your search results within specific brands. You can either type out the brand in the dialogue box provided, or select from the top brands in India (such as Oppo, Xiaomi, Vivo, Apple, and Realme) with the check boxes.
RAM: A very important aspect in choosing the right mobile phone for yourself, the amount of memory a smartphone has governs how well it handles multitasking and gaming performance. Here, you can either type in the amount of RAM you need, or, select from the check boxes we've provided, ranging from less than 512MB of RAM to over 8GB of RAM.
Internal storage: Another very important feature, the amount of internal storage a smartphone has dictates how many apps, music files, and videos you can load onto your smartphone. You can either type out the storage you're looking for, or choose from the check boxes, which go up to 256GB and above.
External storage: Here, you can choose to filter your search results based on whether your smartphone has expandable storage via microSD card, whether it supports USB OTG functionality that allows you to plug in a pen drive, or whether it has a dedicated microSD card slot (instead of a hybrid SIM card slot that requires you to forego the use of one SIM card in the dual-SIM card slot).
Battery capacity: You can easily specify the battery capacity you're looking for with our easy to use filter. You can either type in the battery capacity you're looking for, or, select from the ranges provided, which go up to over 6,000mAh.
Screen size: Smartphone screen sizes have been growing ever larger, and what would have almost been defined as a tablet in previous years is now the norm. You can either type in the screen size you need, or filter search results based on the check boxes we've provided, which go up to 6-inch and above.
Number of rear cameras: Smartphones have in recent years started to include multiple rear cameras, and almost no smartphone comes with less than two rear cameras nowadays. Thus, we've provided a helpful filter where you can specify how many cameras you want. You can either type in the number, or, select from check boxes like dual camera (two sensors), triple camera (three sensors), quad camera (four sensors), and penta camera (five sensors).
Primary rear camera: Here, you can specify the megapixels (or resolution) of the primary rear camera. As we mentioned, most smartphones come with multiple rear camera setups nowadays, but one of those cameras is treated as the primary. With this filter, you can either type in the megapixels resolution you're looking for, or choose from our check boxes, which go up to 21-megapixels and above.
Rear camera feature: An important piece of information is whether a smartphone features a flash module with the rear camera setup, or whether it has autofocus. You can choose to filter your results with these details, by using our check boxes.
Front camera: As with the primary rear camera filter, you can choose what megapixels resolution you want to filter your search results with. You can either type it in, or, choose from the check boxes, which go up to 21-megapixels and above.
Front camera feature: As with the rear camera, it is important to know whether a smartphone's front camera is accompanied by such features as a front flash module, autofocus tech, or whether it is a pop-up camera. Here, you can choose to filter your search results with these filters, using our check boxes.
Operating system: Next up, you can choose what operating system you want to search with. You can select multiple options at once, so for example, both Android and iOS smartphones will be shown in search results.
Network type: Mobile phones today offer many connectivity options, and with this tool, you can choose to filter your search results based on whether the phone offers 3G, 4G, and 5G connectivity.
Number of SIM cards: While most phones sold in India are dual-SIM offerings, this isn't true for all regions across the world. Here, you can choose to filter your search results based on whether the smartphone has a single-SIM card slot, a dual-SIM card slot, or even a triple-SIM card slot.
SIM size: Most mobile phones these days accept only Nano-SIM card sizes, but they remain a few that use a regular SIM card size, a Micro-SIM card size, and even eSIM technology. Here, you can filter your search results using our check boxes for the above-mentioned SIM card sizes.
Processor speed: Not all processors are equal, and it helps to see the top clock speed that a processor is capable of. Here, you can choose a clock speed from the check boxes provided, ranging from less than 1GHz all the up to more than 2.5GHz.
Number of processor cores: Mobile phone processors nowadays have up to 10 CPU cores, and this tool lets you choose how many cores you want with helpful check boxes. To clarify, dual core means two cores, quad core means four cores, hexa core means six cores, octa core means eight cores, and deca core means 10 cores.
More features: Still not found exactly what you're looking for? Well, we've got another helpful tool for you, which lets you select features you want your mobile phone to have, from Wi-Fi to USB Type-C, and more. Select these features with the check boxes we've provided.
Market status: Finally, you can choose to search for phones based on their market status. You can select from one of the three check boxes provided - Available in stores, Upcoming, and Out of stock - to better filter your search results.
