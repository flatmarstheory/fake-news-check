FSSAI Withdraws Order To Mention "Dahi" On Curd Packets After Controversy
Story ProgressBack to homeFSSAI Withdraws Order To Mention "Dahi" On Curd Packets After ControversyThe order had sparked widespread controversy, particularly in southern states where it was seen as an example of "Hindi imposition" by the central government.Toshita SahniUpdated: March 31, 2023 15:27 ISTRead Time: 2 minfacebooktwitterWhatsAppredditSnapchatE-mailPrinterThe exact nomenclature for curd packets has stirred up a controversy recentlyPhoto Credit: iStockHighlightsA few weeks back, the FSSAI had mandated the use of "dahi" on packetsThe move was a highly controversial one for certain reasonsFind out why the directive has now been rolled backOn 10 March, a letter from FSSAI mandated the use of the Hindi word "dahi" in place of the label 'Fermented Milk' on curd packets. The order sparked a large-scale controversy, especially in the southern states of Karnataka, Kerala, and Tamil Nadu. On Wednesday, the Chief Minister of Tamil Nadu, MK Stalin, spoke out against the order, claiming it was another example of 'Hindi imposition' by the Centre. Many other groups also saw the directive in a similar light. Yesterday (30 March), the FSSAI decided to withdraw the controversial rule and provide fresh guidelines.Also Read: Man Claims He Opened Checked-In Luggage To Find Someone Drank His Expensive WhiskeyIn a tweet on 29 March, MK Stalin wrote, "The unabashed insistences of #HindiImposition have come to the extent of directing us to label even a curd packet in Hindi, relegating Tamil & Kannada in our own states. Such brazen disregard to our mother tongues will make sure those responsible are banished from South forever." The letter from FSSAI directed the Karnataka Milk Federation to label curds as dahi and write the Kannada equivalent ("mosaru") in brackets after that. A similar directive had been issued to the Tamil Nadu Cooperative Milk Producers Federation regarding the use of "tair" and "tayir" for curds. The prominence given to the Hindi word formed the basis of their objections.Also Read: Bengaluru's Second Official Food Street Set To Transform Former DumpyardThe FSSAI revised its directive via a press release yesterday. It stated, "As many representations were received recently on the omission of the term 'curd' from the Standards of Fermented Milk Products, it has been decided that FBOs may use the term Curd along with any other designation (prevalent regional common name) in brackets on the label." Accordingly, Curd can also be labelled as per the following examples: 'Curd (Dahi)' OR 'Curd (Mosaru)' OR 'Curd (Zaamut daud)' OR 'Curd (Thayir)' OR 'Curd (Perugu).'".
