Samsung's Galaxy S22 Ultra was, and still is, a very capable smartphone. However, it was more about merging the Note line and Galaxy line above anything else. We finally had a well-integrated S Pen in a camera-oriented Galaxy S series smartphone. It was the ultimate Samsung smartphone, with nothing left out, priced from Rs. 1,09,999. Rather than going for a complete overhaul this year with the Galaxy S23 Ultra, Samsung has created a device that will feel very familiar to a Galaxy S22 Ultra user, but with a twist.

Samsung Galaxy S23 Ultra Review
Samsung Galaxy S23 Ultra Summary
The Samsung Galaxy S23 Ultra is the most premium device in Samsung’s S23 lineup. Its design, while premium and still unique, has not changed by much, but Samsung has made use of sustainable materials in its construction.
The display is still the best you can get on an Android smartphone in India and offers the same high screen refresh rate as last year’s model, but its touch sampling rate fell short of our gaming expectations.
A highlight of the Galaxy S23 Ultra is its unique processor which Samsung has customised to its own requirements. Software operation is buttery smooth but there are tons of bloatware both from Samsung and third-party apps, that can thankfully be uninstalled.
Camera performance is better than last year’s Ultra and this is mainly down to the new sensor of the primary camera. Zoom performance has also improved and so has video recording which can now record proper 8K footage at 30fps. Battery life is solid but charging is relatively slow
