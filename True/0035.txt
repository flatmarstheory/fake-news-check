ABOUT US
Our Story
The Quint, launched in March 2015, is India’s fastest-growing pure-play digital news and views platform. Mobile-first and highly interactive, we bring a distinctive combination of compelling, credible, and community-driven journalism blended with innovative, visually powerful storytelling formats — to deliver incisive takes on politics, policy, gender, entertainment, sports, health and wellness, web culture, and more.
Our team is a collective of reporters, storytellers, editors, video and audio producers, designers, product managers, and data analysts, who have cut their teeth on the best news teams in the country. At the helm, we have some of the best minds in the industry who have honed their craft for years in the media, and today, lead a fearless newsroom. As a newsroom, we are notably diverse, and we continue to acknowledge a sincere commitment towards making inclusivity a necessity.
We are participative in our approach to newsgathering — with a robust citizen journalism vertical, My Report — and we partner with our readers in our hunt for fake news through our WebQoof vertical that debunks mis/disinformation in both Hindi and English. We are certified by the International Fact-Checking Network (IFCN) — a recognition of our expertise, bipartisan approach, and credibility.
Our reporters fan out into deep interiors of the country for ground reports — finding stories that often get drowned out in prime-time debates. We have eminent authors writing for us, and we maintain the diversity of voices on our site.
Our journalism aims to be extensive, yet inclusive; hard-hitting, yet sensitive. We are a platform for marginalised voices and strive to bring stories from India’s most remote corners. We have tried to lead conversations on issues that matter — and continue to bring you unheard voices, humanise big events, and propel change.
How Are We Funded?
The Quint is owned by Quint Digital Media Limited, a company listed on the BSE Limited. Raghav Bahl and Ritu Kapur are the Promoters of Quint Digital Media Limited (formerly known as Gaurav Mercantiles Limited). Please refer to the corporate website of the company at www.quintdigitalmedia.com.
The Quint’s Special Initiatives
At The Quint, we go beyond daily headlines by diversifying into focus areas and community tools that are crucial to our journalism.
•
My Report
Our robust and award-winning citizen journalism vertical, My Report is a community-driven platform that passes the microphone to India’s janta, allowing you to voice your concerns, raise issues that matter to you, and report on your most pressing grievances.
The process is simple, participative, and personal. Reach out to the My Report team and they will walk you through the steps to tell your story more effectively and powerfully. Reach out at myreport@thequint.com or WhatsApp at +919999008335.
•
WebQoof
From using in-house technology to on-ground reportage, our fact-checking arm WebQoof integrates multiple sources of information to verify dubious claims and forwards. In 2020, WebQoof became a signatory of the Poynter Institute’s International Fact-Checking Network (IFCN) ‘Code of Principles’. IFCN principles are followed by fact-checkers across the globe to promote transparent and non-partisan fact-checking.
As propaganda and hate-driven disinformation campaigns escalate rapidly, WebQoof has been at the forefront of exposing false viral claims and bringing out the truth. Today, WebQoof attracts a dedicated audience that reads our stories and participates by bringing attention to claims circulating on social media. A video-first platform, WebQoof attempts to convert its fact-checked stories into quick videos, so it reaches a wider audience.
To report fake news or get a forward/viral claim fact-checked, write to us at webqoof@thequint.com or WhatsApp at +919643651818.

Special Projects
The Quint’s Special Projects include powerful documentaries, impactful long-form investigative reports, and deep dives into issues of social and national interest. Our journalists often risk their lives and health to cover these stories. Many of these projects are developed over months; several adopt innovative storytelling methods that are often the first of their kind in the industry; and some are accessed from India’s remote or inaccessible regions with the help of local stringers and journalists. Check out our ongoing special projects HERE.
Focus Areas
The Quint periodically takes stock of topics, issues, and causes that are relevant to the times we live in and ensures that these stories do not go untold. Some of our top focus areas include gender, health, law, economy, everyday communalism, and unemployment.
In addition, we are also building a vertical around climate change, through detailed, on-ground coverage of vulnerable populations and landscapes. Through a mix of documentaries, special reports, expert interviews, and more, we hope to highlight the issues caused by this global crisis through the perspectives of those on the frontlines of it.
Supporting India’s Growing Digital News Media
The Quint is a founding member of the DIGIPUB News India Foundation, established to help ensure a healthy and robust digital news ecosystem. The platform represents digital news media organisations, with its membership open to digital-only ventures as well as media commentators and independent journalists active in the digital news space.
Together, the members of the DIGIPUB News India Foundation aim to represent, amplify, and evolve best practices that are independent and uphold the highest standards of journalism.
The Quint’s Membership Community
The Quint's special projects, investigations, and fact-checks make us stand out in the clutter. But producing these stories takes up time, resources, and risks borne by our on-ground reporters. By financially empowering our journalism, Quint Members not only help us meet our production targets but ensure that these stories are heard and keep independent journalism alive, unbiased, and relevant.
These members enjoy a host of perks, including access to paywalled content, an ad-free experience on The Quint’s website, early previews of our Special Projects, and more.
