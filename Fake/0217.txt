During his visit, PM will flag off India's 11th Vande Bharat Express train on the Bhopal-New Delhi route.  The deployment of the train on this route comes as a part of the long-standing demand of people to have a faster train between the two cities. Furthermore, the train is expected to reduce the travel time between the two cities. Expectations are, it will cover a distance of 709 km in 7 hours and 50 minutes.
Bhopal-New Delhi Vande Bharat Express: Route
The new Vande Bharat train will begin its journey from Rani Kamlapati railway station in Bhopal and will arrive at New Delhi Railway station. During its journey, the train will pass through Agra Cantt station, Veerangana Laxmibai Jhansi, and Gwalior railway station. However, changes are expected in the train's stoppage in Delhi. Some reports suggest, instead of New Delhi railway station the train will halt at Hazrat Nizamuddin station.
