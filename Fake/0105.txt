Bharatiya Janata Party leader and former MLA Mallikarjun Khuba resigned from the party and joined the JDS on Friday. He was a JDS MLA from the Basavakalyana assembly constituency for two terms but he had quit the party due to differences and joined the BJP later on.
The move by the leader comes ahead of elections in Karnataka. Khuba was an MLA from the Basavakalyana Assembly constituency and this time, he's likely to contest on a JDS ticket from the Basavakalyana assembly constituency.
BJP expelled Khuba for six years in 2021
In 2021, BJP expelled its former legislator Mallikarjun Khuba for six years on the grounds of indiscipline and “anti-party activity” and for contesting as an independent against the party's candidate Sharanu Salagar in the Basavakalyan Assembly.
In 2018, he joined the BJP and lost to B Narayan Rao of Congress in the 2018 Assembly polls. He joined the party after having differences with JDS' top leadership.READ | Karnataka 1st PUC Result 2023 declared, here's direct link to check
