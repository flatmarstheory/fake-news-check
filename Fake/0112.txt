Two weeks after the racing world witnessed a dramatic conclusion to the Formula 1 2023 Saudi Arabian GP, the grid is all set for the Round 3 of the season in Melbourne. The reigning world champion Max Verstappen heads into the F1 2023 Australian GP with just one point lead over teammate Sergio Perez in the 2023 Drivers world championship standings. While Perez won the second round of the season at Jeddah, Verstappen stole the point for the fastest lap and finished at P2 to maintain his lead in the championship.
Meanwhile, Fernando Alonso became a big talking point for the paddock after the Saudi Arabian GP because of what happened after the podium celebrations. Alonso was handed a 10 seconds penalty after the race, which demoted him to a P4 finish. However, the stewards later reinstated Alonso’s podium finish as he ended up earning the 100th podium finish of his career.
Will Ferrari and Mercedes gain places in the F1 standings?
Heading into the Albert Park circuit, Ferrari and Mercedes will be looking for a better weekend. On the other hand, McLaren would be hoping to leave their woes behind and come up with a better performance in the first home race for rookie Oscar Piastri.
