According to the sources, both the parties are accusing each other for the clash, but no complaint has been reportedly filed by any of the parties regarding the incident to the police. However, the local police are yet to respond to the issue.
Meanwhile, after the scuffle between YSRCP and TDP councillors in the municipal council meeting in Tenali area of Guntur district, the TDP members started protesting against YSRCP.
