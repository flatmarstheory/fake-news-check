More about The Elephant Whisperers
The Elephant Whisperers depicts the care and love showered by caretakers, Bellie and her husband Bomman, in rearing abandoned baby elephants at the government-run Theppakkadu Elephant Camp in the Nilgiris District. The short film was on two elephant calves Raghu and Ammu. It created history earlier this month as it lifted the Oscar for Best Documentary Short, becoming the first India-backed production to manage a win in this category.
As soon as victory for The Elephant Whisperers was announced at the 95th Oscar Awards, Guneet Monga and Kartiki Gonsalves took to the stage to receive the honour. The film's director, Kartiki Gonsalves said in her acceptance speech, "I stand here today to speak for the sacred bond between us and our natural world, for the respect of indigenous communities and empathy towards other living beings we share our space with, and finally for co-existence. Thank you to the academy for recognising our film, highlighting indigenous people and animals."
