Surprise inspection finds liquor and condoms in the principal’s room of a missionary school
In a shocking incident reported from the Morena district of Madhya Pradesh, packets of condoms, and liquor bottles were recovered from a missionary school during a surprise inspection by Child Right Protection Commission.


The inspection was conducted by the State Commission for the Protection of Child Rights (SCPCR) on Saturday.

The SCPCR team found beds, liquor and condoms, egg trays, and gas cylinders. “I saw a gas cylinder and other objectionable stuff, including liquor bottles. Police are investigating the whole matter,” Nivedita Sharma, a member of the SCPCR inspection team said, adding that she had brought the matter to the notice of the District Collector.

An FIR has been lodged against the school’s principal and a detailed investigation has been demanded from the police.

“When we reached there for a routine inspection, we were surprised to know how both corners of the school were attached from the inside… It was a room and liquor bottles and condoms were found there. It was like a complete residential setup. It does not belong to only one person, but more people came out of the building who were living there. It was being used as an accommodation,” Sharma told IANS.

She further said that at least 15 beds were lying in that room and there was no CCTV camera.

“The question arises that when CCTV cameras are installed in other locations of the building, why was that particular section left out. If the principal said he wasn’t staying there, then who was staying, and why 15 beds are present there. More importantly, why does that room have a direct entrance with classrooms of girl students,” Nivedita Sharma said.

She further said that liquor is not allowed on the school campus at all. “It is a violation of the law. The excise department is also taking action on the matter as it is also illegal that nobody can keep such amounts of liquor. Some other objectionable stuff, including condoms, were also found,” she added.

Following the inspection, the District Collector ordered the seizure of the school. Based on the recovery of foreign liquor bottles, the school principal has been booked by the excise department.
