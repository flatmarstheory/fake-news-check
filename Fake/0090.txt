IPL 2023: Chennai Super Kings captain MS Dhoni on Friday made his return to the Indian Premier League after a gap of nearly one year. Dhoni returned to competitive cricket during the opening match of IPL 2023 against Hardik Pandya's Gujarat Titans. While batting in the first innings of the match, Dhoni smashed a mammoth six as the crowd went berserk at the Narendra Modi Stadium. The incident occurred in the final over of Chennai's innings. Debutant Joshua Little was bowling for Gujarat Titans at that time.

MS Dhoni came in and scored a quickfire 14 off just 7 balls.
