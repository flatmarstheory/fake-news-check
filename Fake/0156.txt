Republic Originals | Russians In Rayagada: 4 Russian tourists, 1 hotel in Rayagada, and 2 mysterious deaths
Four Russian tourists travel to a quaint district in southern Odisha and two of them die under mysterious circumstances. The plot reads like the beginning of a detective novel.

What followed is shrouded in mystery. The death of Bidanov due to a purported heart attack on December 22 and the death of Russian oligarch and Putin critic Antov after falling from his hotel in Rayagada on December 24 has raised many questions. A Republic Original Investigation.
