Priyank Kanoongo, chairman of the National Commission for Protection Of Child Rights (NCPCR) alleged that he was beaten up by Biswak Mukherjee, a police officer at the Tiljila police station in West Bengal. He claimed that the officers were secretly recording the investigations of the NCPCR. Kanoongo alleged that he was physically assaulted when he protested against the recording.
"Bengal police officer Biswak Mukherjee snatched and beat me up at Tiljila police station in West Bengal. The policemen @NCPCR_ were surreptitiously recording the investigation proceedings. They beat me up for protesting," Kanoongo tweeted.
पश्चिम बंगाल के तिलजिला थाने में बंगाल पुलिस के अफ़सर बिस्वाक मुखर्जी ने मेरे साथ छीना छपटी व मार पीट की है।
पुलिस के लोग @NCPCR_ की जाँच कार्यवाही की चोरी छिपे रिकॉर्डिंग कर रहे थे।
विरोध करने पर मेरे साथ मार पीट की है।

Widespread protests swept over Kolkata against the state government as locals were angry over the delay in police action to find the minor. The locals even vandalised and torched vehicles blocking the roads in the Tiljala area. As for the accused, he confessed to murdering the child after stalking her for around two weeks. Sources even claimed that he killed her on the advice of a Tantrik. Post-mortem reports revealed that the girl was also sexually harassed.READ | Berlin museum presents 100 works by artist Gerhard Richter
The NCPCR is said to have finally arrived for investigation after a major roadblock that it faced from Bengal's top child rights body. According to PTI, its request to visit the state for the probe was snubbed by the West Bengal Commission for Protection of Child Rights (WBPCR) saying the visit was "not necessary" as it already took cognisance. Kanoongo then questioned what is it that the administration is hiding. READ | Howrah clashes: Political blame game sees BJP, TMC go hammer & tongs against each other
