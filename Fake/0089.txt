Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury writes to LS Speaker Om Birla
Leader of Congress in Lok Sabha, Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury in his letter to Speaker Om Birla, said, "The basic idea behind the Standing Committee system is that every time a new committee may not be formed to examine a Bill. Moreover, the Speaker/Chairman can refer a Bill to the Departmentally Related Standing Committee even if the House is not in Session. As the Speaker, you are the protector of the rules and conventions of the House. Most of the Bills are now referred to Joint Committees and not to Standing Committees. In long run, this will make the Standing Committee system redundant."
