IPL 2023: During the toss for the IPL 2023 opener between Gujarat Titans and Chennai Super Kings, former India coach Ravi Shastri made a mistake by introducing Hardik Pandya's team as Gujarat Giants instead of Gujarat Titans. This slip-up caused confusion on Twitter as Gujarat Giants is actually a team in the Women's Premier League (WPL), which just concluded its first season. Gujarat Giants even reacted to the post but later deleted their tweet due to unknown reasons.
Shastri's error led to numerous fans questioning the mix-up on the social media platform. Gujarat Titans skipper Hardik Pandya was also seen passing a smile after Shastri made the mistake. Nevertheless, the IPL match proceeded as scheduled with both teams battling it out on the field at the Narendra Modi Stadium and the defending champions convincingly winning the match by 5 wickets
