#NationWantsToKnow | In the latest edition of Republic Media Network Editor-in-Chief Arnab Goswami's Nation Wants to Know, Senior Advocate and BJP Rajya Sabha MP Mahesh Jethmalani doubled down on his criticism of the Congress party and its senior leaders leaving no stones unturned in exposing their alleged links to China in a no holds barred conversation. He also reflected on the controversial BBC docuseries by the British media house which, according to the BJP MP, also is part of a larger conspiracy to malign India's image.
