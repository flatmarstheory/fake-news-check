SC refuses to entertain plea to restrain Justice Chandra Victoria Gowri from taking oath as HC Judge
With anxious moments persisting in the morning, the Supreme Court on Tuesday refused to entertain pleas seeking to restrain lawyer Lekshmana Chandra Victoria Gowri (49) from taking oath as an additional judge of the Madras High Court, saying a “consultative process” had taken place before her name was recommended by the collegium for the appointment. The argument started before a Special Bench comprising Justices Sanjiv Khanna and B R Gavai at 10:25 am and Gowri’s swearing-in took place at 10:46 am, the apex court at 10:53 am dismissed petitions seeking to stop her swearing-in.


‘Not entertaining writ petitions’ against appointment, says SC
The apex court said Gowri has been appointed as an additional judge and if she is not true to the oath or does not discharge her duties in accordance with the oath, the collegium is entitled to take a view of that, while pointing out that there have been instances where people have not been made permanent judges. Five minutes before the top court dismissed two pleas against Gowri’s appointment, she was administered the oath of office as an additional judge by Madras High Court’s Acting Chief Justice T Raja at around 10:48 am.

“We are not entertaining the writ petition. Reasons will follow,” said a special bench of Justices Sanjiv Khanna and B R Gavai, which assembled at 10:25 am to hear the plea, five minutes before the scheduled time of the court. The two pleas, including one moved by three Madras High Court lawyers, opposed Gowri’s appointment as an additional judge.

The bench told senior advocate Raju Ramachandran, who appeared in the matter for the petitioners, that there have been cases where people with political backgrounds have taken oath as judges of the Supreme Court and high courts. “Mr Ramachandran, there have been cases where people with political backgrounds have taken oath over here also, as judges of the Supreme Court and high courts,” it said.

Communist lawyers tried, but they failed
“The collegium overruled that. The collegium said personal or political views of a candidate cannot be a ground for not recommending his name,” Justice Gavai observed. “As a matter of fact, before I came here, I also had a political background and I have been a judge for the last 20 years,” he said.

Many persons in politics became Judges in India in the past. Justice Krishna Iyer was Minister in Kerala’s Communist Government. Justice S K Hegde and Justice Bahrul Islam were Congress’ Rajya Sabha MPs. The Communist lawyers in Tamil Nadu was opposing Justice Victoria Gowri’s appointment citing that she was in BJP’s women’s wing and appeared in TV debates supporting right wingers.

Delhi: Manish Sisodia 'Architect Of Conspiracy' In Excise Policy Case, Says Court, Denies Bail

Delhi: Manish Sisodia 'Architect Of Conspiracy' In Excise Policy Case, Says Court, Denies Bail
Former Delhi deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia
Former Delhi deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia's bail plea in the excise policy case has been rejected by the court, which accused him of being the architect of the criminal conspiracy.

The court stated that Sisodia's release may hamper the ongoing investigation, and that he played the most important role in the conspiracy's formulation and implementation.

Special Judge M K Nagpal, who had reserved order on the AAP leader's bail plea on 24 March, said he was not inclined to release him at this stage.

'Thus, it is clear from the above discussion that the applicant had played the most important and vital role in the criminal conspiracy and he had been deeply involved in the formulation as well as the implementation of the said policy to ensure the achievement of objectives of the said conspiracy...

'Thus, as per allegations made by the prosecution and the evidence collected in support thereof so far, the applicant can prima facie be held to be the architect of the said criminal conspiracy,' the judge said.

'... This court is not inclined to release the applicant on bail at this stage of investigation of the case as his release may adversely affect the ongoing investigation and will also seriously hamper the progress thereof. Therefore, this bail application filed on behalf of the applicant is being dismissed,' the judge said in his 34-page order.

Sisodia had sought bail, claiming he was not a flight risk and that no incriminating evidence was found against him by the CBI. However, the CBI opposed his bail plea, alleging that he was in a position to influence witnesses and destroy evidence.

His lawyer had said the policy was formulated 'purely in the normal course'.

Sisodia was arrested by the CBI on 26 February in connection with alleged corruption in the scrapped Delhi Excise Policy 2021-22, and was later arrested by the ED on 9 March in a separate case being probed by the CBI.
