‘Same-sex marriage would cause complete havoc’: Religious leaders
Many Muslim, Christian, and Jain religious leaders have written to Chief Justice of India D Y Chandrachud to cite their religious beliefs to express opposition to same-sex marriage, an issue being heard by the Supreme Court. Sayed Salman Chishty of the Chishty Foundation, Ajmer, has conveyed his “concerns and reservations” to CJI, claiming that any legal validation for same-sex marriage will contradict India’s religious, social and moral values, and cause “havoc” with the delicate balance of personal laws and accepted societal values. Communion of Churches in India and Jain leaders also wrote the Chief Justice and President of India, expressing their opposition against pleas seeking legal validation of same-sex marriage.


“In India’s secular yet multi-faith context, which is already recognized as the most diverse country in the world, this is indeed a very complex and sensitive issue that needs careful deliberation and understanding before opinions are made part of national policies,” he said. Chishty cited Islamic beliefs to oppose the plea seeking legal validation for such a marriage.

The Communion of Churches in India has echoed similar views in a letter to President Droupadi Murmu and CJI. Prakash P Thomas of the Communion of Churches in India expressed “shock” at such a plea. According to Christian beliefs, marriage is a divine institution made by God, and cannot accept the union of two homosexuals as marriage, he claimed, urging the President to ensure the status quo on marriage.

Jain Guru Acharya Lokesh said legal sanction to same-sex marriage would go against the ethos of India’s ancient values-based society. In Indian culture, especially among Jains, marriage is a foundation to reproduction for extending the family tree, he said. Pravez Hanif of a Pasmanda (backward) Muslim group echoed the view of these groups.

The Government of India has also opposed in the Supreme Court a batch of pleas seeking legal validation of same-sex marriage, saying it would cause complete havoc with the delicate balance of personal laws and accepted societal values.

The petitions demanding legal validation of same-sex marriage is now pending before the Supreme Court of India. The Government of India already opposed the petitions.[1]

From One Ex-CM To Another: Here's Who Could Be Taking On Siddaramaiah In Karnataka
bySwarajya Staff-Mar 31, 2023 06:20 PM +05:30 IST
From One Ex-CM To Another: Here's Who Could Be Taking On Siddaramaiah In Karnataka
Siddaramaiah, a former chief minister of Karnataka (2013-2018) and leader of the opposition in the Karnataka Legislative Assembly
B S Yediyurappa may field his son against Siddaramaiah in Karnataka elections, which are set for 10 May.

This possibility was presented by Yediyurappa himself on Thursday (30 March), at an emergency press conference in Bengaluru, before Karnataka's chief minister, too, brought up the matter the next day.

Siddaramaiah — a former chief minister, as is Yediyurappa — will contest from Varuna seat in Mysuru district, presently held by his son Yathindra, in what is set to be his last election.

It is said that discussions on whether to field B Y Vijayendra, Yediyurappa's son and vice president for the BJP in Karnataka, in Varuna have been ongoing within the BJP fold, with elections just over a month away.

Basavaraj Bommai told reporters on Friday (31 March) that Yediyurappa and the Parliamentary Board will take a call on fielding Vijayendra from Varuna constituency.

"As our senior leader B S Yediyurappa has said, we (BJP) will give a tough fight (in Varuna)," Bommai said.

Yediyurappa, who bowed out of electoral politics in February, is spearheading the BJP's election campaign in Karnataka.

He believes the Congress can secure at most 70 seats in the 224-seat assembly, in contrast to Karnataka Congress chief D K Shivakumar's forecast of 150 seats for his party.

Meanwhile, Yediyurappa has been in firefighting mode. Earlier this week, protesters from the backward communities, including Banjara, threw stones at his house in Shivamogga, in response to Bommai's proposed change in reservation.

India To Take Strong Measures, Including Blacklisting, Against Pro-Khalistanis Involved in Violence Outside Indian Missions In The West

India To Take Strong Measures, Including Blacklisting, Against Pro-Khalistanis Involved in Violence Outside Indian Missions In The West
Pro-Khalistan activists stage a demonstration. (Representative image) (ANI)
The central government is planning significant measures against Khalistani groups responsible for the violent protests outside the Indian High Commission and embassies in Canada, London, and San Francisco, according to the reports.

Recently, Indian missions in London, British Columbia, and San Francisco were vandalised by alleged pro-Khalistan activists in response to the police action against Amritpal Singh, a Khalistani supporter and leader of 'Waris Punjab De' in Punjab.

The authorities are using CCTV footage to identify those involved in the violence, and have requested the UK, Canadian, and US governments to take action against the culprits.

The Delhi police have already initiated an investigation into the attacks on the Indian High Commission in London. If evidence is found against the protesters, they may be placed on the country's 'blacklist'.

According to media reports, National Security Advisor Ajit Doval is expected to discuss the issue of violence with the British government urge them to take strong action against separatists who are attempting to polarize the Indian diaspora in Britain.

Additionally, there are reports suggesting that the Indian government is waiting for the British government to take action against the protesters.
