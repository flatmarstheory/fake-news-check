ED crackdown on Chinese loan apps; freezes Rs.106 cr
On Wednesday, the Enforcement Directorate (ED) said it has freezed Rs.106 crore lying in merchant IDs and bank accounts concerning the Chinese loan app fraud case. It had earlier attached Rs.77.25 crore from bank accounts and payment gateways.


The ED had initiated an investigation based on FIRs registered by the cyber crime police station, Bengaluru, under various sections of the Karnataka Money Lenders Act, Information Technology Act, Karnataka Prohibition of Charging Exorbitant Interest Act, and the Indian Penal Code against numerous entities in connection with their involvement in extortion and harassment of public who had availed small amounts of loans through mobile apps being run by entities controlled by Chinese nationals.

The ED investigation revealed the modus operandi of these entities. They were incorporated by appointing dummy directors on behalf of Chinese nationals, which used to obtain KYC documents of company staff and appoint them as directors in such entities and even opened bank accounts in their names, without their knowledge or prior consent.

“These entities were involved in criminal activities by submitting fake addresses in KYC documents and taking assistance from various professionals and other persons. They provided instant short-term loans to the public through loan apps and other means and charged high processing fees and exorbitant interest rates. The amounts were subsequently recovered from the public by these companies by way of threatening and causing mental torture over the phone as well as by contacting their family members, relatives, and friends asking for the money,” the ED said.

The official said that these Chinese-controlled entities indulged in huge money laundering activities through the merchant IDs maintained with various payment gateways, such as Razorpay, Cashfree, Paytm, PayU, Easebuzz, and bank accounts maintained with various banks, thereby generating proceeds of crime.

Further probe into the case is currently underway.

Tragedy Strikes Indore Temple On Ram Navami: Death Toll Rises To 35, Search For Missing Person Underway

Tragedy Strikes Indore Temple On Ram Navami: Death Toll Rises To 35, Search For Missing Person Underway
Indore temple stepwell roof collapse incident
On Friday, the death toll in the Indore temple stepwell roof collapse incident increased to 35, with one person still missing as rescue efforts continue, according to an official.

The mishap occurred during a 'havan' ceremony held on the occasion of Ram Navami at the Beleshwar Mahadev Jhulelal temple in Patel Nagar, Indore.

The slab constructed on top of an ancient stepwell, or 'bawdi', gave way and caused several devotees to fall into the water reservoir below. The temple, built around four decades ago, had covered a square-shaped stepwell measuring about 20 feet by 20 feet.

"Our search operation, being carried out with the help of Army, National Disaster Response Force (NDRF) and State Disaster Response Force (SDRF), is nearing completion. So far, 35 bodies have been recovered from the well," Indore District Magistrate Dr Ilayaraja T told reporters from the site of the incident.

The bodies of all persons, except one, whose names were mentioned in the list of missing persons, have been recovered so far, he said.

There is a lot of silt in the well and it is being removed to trace the missing person, he added.

The rescue operation was initially hampered as the temple was built in a narrow space and a wall was broken to lower a pipe to pump out water from the well, officials said.

According to an eyewitness, the collapse occurred due to the large crowd of devotees present at the temple during the religious ceremony, as the floor could not withstand the weight. Local residents have stated that the temple was constructed by placing a slab over the ancient stepwell.
