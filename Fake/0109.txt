Chris Gayle made his foray into IPL commentary as the former West Indies batsman is doing commentary in the Indian Premier League. His new stint is for Jio Cinema who acquired the digital rights of IPL for the next five years. A number of former cricketers have been roped in by Jio to make this tournament more exciting.
Netizens slam Chris Gayle for his poor commentary on Jio Cinema
But Gayle's debut innings in the commentary box haven't gone well with the viewers as calls have been made to remove him from the commentary panel. Netizens have provided their fiery reactions on social media.
@JioCinema, please get the regular commentators on for IPL streaming, Chris gayle is only good with bat and definitely not with mic. Lot of LOL and less commentary when he is around. ABD needs to grow up as well... @IPL @bhogleharsha @RaviShastriOfc

Chris Gayle and Grame Swann commentary bit too casual for my taste. @JioCinema and they are speaking at the same time and can't hear either one of them. Lastly too much laughing and almost getting annoying

Poor commentary panel including #chrisgayle #scottstyris #brettlee #jiocinema4k #IPL2023 #cskvsgg
‚Äî Dr. Anish Agarwal (@anishagarwal256) March 31, 2023
Chris Gayle is at his WORST, perfect example of how a commentator should not be
‚Äî The Rogue Prince (@JonSnow365) March 31, 2023
Still no substance, no substantial speak on strategy, player's strength. I heard them humoring Dube's surname! And Chris Gayle's laugh is not pleasing to ears! ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

How much do you rate Gayle's outlandish outfit on 10? ü§£ pic.twitter.com/sc3Idai3uI
