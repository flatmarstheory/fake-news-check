The murder accused extradited from Saudi Arabia by Kerala Police under Operation Trishul
The Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) has got Mohammed Hanif Makkat, who was wanted by Kerala Police allegedly involved in a kidnapping and murder case, deported from Saudi Arabia under ‘Operation Trishul‘, Sources have confirmed the news.


Makkat was involved in the brutal kidnapping cum murder case of one Karim which took place in 2006. The sources said that Hanif was deported from Saudi Arabia with the help of Interpol. After committing the murder he fled abroad. A Red Corner Notice was also issued against him by the federal probe agency.

Sources said, Interpol agencies, in collaboration with the Saudi government, brought back the fugitive under Operation Trishul – which was launched by the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) launched last year to get back fugitives living abroad.

Indian officials informed Saudi Arabia about the location of the suspect and requested they send in a team to bring him back to India. A Kerala Police team on Sunday brought Mohammed Haneefa Makkatt back to India.

As of now, the CBI has brought as many as 33 fugitive criminals who have fled India under ‘Operation Trishul’. This operation was started in the mid of 2022. Last year the CBI was successful in bringing back 27 fugitive criminals from abroad. This year as of now they have brought seven fugitive criminals so far.

Last week, one Harchand Singh Gill, wanted in an Rs.45,000 crore chit fund scam, was brought to India from Fiji.

Operation Trishul helps geo-locate criminals in other countries with help from Interpol.

As part of the operation, officials investigate and locate crime proceeds in financial crime cases as well.

The CBI sources said that their operation will continue.

Just as we now know the number of criminals brought back, can someone publish the total amount of cash recovered since 2014 and value of properties attached by ED with comparative figures for 10 years before 2014. That will possibly shut a majority of the mouths.
