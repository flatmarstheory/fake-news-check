All of these priced are ex-showroom only.
×Royal Enfield Super Meteor 650 Front Design2/9As for design, the Super Meteor has a typical laid-back stance, as seen in American cruisers. Fat USD forks with tear-drop-style tank design, low-slung seat, and rounded-off rear fender accentuate its overall appeal.
×Royal Enfield Super Meteor 650 Rear Design3/9The tail lamp looks a bit odd, a seamless integration in the fender itself would've made it look more modern. The rear rim measures 16 inches in diameter, lending a low-slung appeal to the bike. It is shod with a 150-section tyre.
×Royal Enfield Super Meteor 650 Instrument Cluster4/9The twin-pod instrument cluster is quite like the smaller Meteor 350's. It does come with a Google-powered Tripper navigation pod, but a new design would've been welcomed rather warmly.
×Royal Enfield Super Meteor 650 Cockpit5/9The handlebar is wide, however, I at 5'6" in height wished it was a little closer to me for a more relaxed riding position. Nevertheless, a longer handlebar is available as an accessory. Although, it is easy to manage this 240 kilo motorcycle.
×Royal Enfield Super Meteor 650 Seat6/9The seat height is set at 740 mm, and the seat is wide and comfy. For increased comfort, a touring seat is available as an option. Similarly, buyers can get the backrest for the pillion seat.
×Royal Enfield Super Meteor 650 Engine Gearbox7/9Powertrain is borrowed from the Interceptor 650. The 270-degree cranked motor puts out 47 bhp against 52 Nm, and it is paired to a 6-speed gearbox. The combination offers immense low-end grunt and mid-range torque, making cruising an easy affair.
×Royal Enfield Super Meteor 650 Air Box8/9Interestingly, the air box on this powerplant is changed for Super Meteor 650's character, which mimics Americans. Also, the tuning of the motor is altered, and so is the case with the gear ratios.
×Royal Enfield Super Meteor 650 Brakes9/9Showa's big-piston, separate-function forks are used on the Super Meteor 650. Rear-end gets a twin shock setup. The setting is on a slightly stiffer side. However, the brakes are just amazing on this cruiser with a 320 mm rotor on the front and a 300 mm disc at the rear. They come from Bybre and offer dual-channel ABS.
