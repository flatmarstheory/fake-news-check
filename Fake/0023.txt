ARNAB'S LEAD STORY
#IndiaBansPFI
Anyone associated with the PFI should be arrested and picked up. Just the ban is not enough. None of the PFI leaders should be allowed to escape the country. By dissolving the PFI after the ban this morning, the PFI leaders are trying to avoid arrest and legal scrutiny. They must be rounded up.
