In the wake of the anarchic situation in West Bengal following the Howrah violence, Home Minister Amit Shah took stock of the situation and spoke to the state's Governor CV Ananda Bose.
In another phone call, West Bengal BJP leadership is said to have given Shah the details of the incident that took place in Howrah and has even demanded the Home Ministry to intervene and restore law and order. The Home Minister has reportedly talked to a few state BJP leaders including state BJP President Sukanta Majumdar, who briefed him on the prevailing situation. READ | Ram Navami celebrations marred by deaths of 14 devotees; clashes in Bengal, Gujarat
