(2.5/5)
GULMOHAR
Cast : Sharmila Tagore, Manoj Bajpayee, Simran, Suraj Sharma, Amol Palekar, Anuraag Arora, Chandan Roy
Albeit the many subplots are difficult to process, the amiable presence of Sharmila Tagore and the masterful act by Manoj Bajpayee makes film a pleasant watch
(3/5)
TAJ: DIVIDED BY BLOOD
Cast : Dharmendra, Naseeruddin Shah, Aditi Rao Hydari, Sandhya Mridul, Rahul Bose, Zarina Wahab and Aashim Gulati
Taj: Divided by Blood does not have the complexity and vision required to do justice to a significant historical period, yet is intriguing in bits and parts
(2.5/5)
SELFIEE
Cast : Akshay Kumar, Emraan Hashmi, Nushrratt Bharuccha, Diana Penty and Abhimanyu Singh
Despite some clever pointers and Akshay Kumar in his element, Selfiee is not exactly an insightful reflection upon fandom/stardom
(2/5)

The Tribune, now published from Chandigarh, started publication on February 2, 1881, in Lahore (now in Pakistan). It was started by Sardar Dyal Singh Majithia, a public-spirited philanthropist, and is run by a trust comprising four eminent persons as trustees.
The Tribune, the largest selling English daily in North India, publishes news and views without any bias or prejudice of any kind. Restraint and moderation, rather than agitational language and partisanship, are the hallmarks of the paper. It is an independent newspaper in the real sense of the term.
The Tribune has two sister publications, Punjabi Tribune (in Punjabi) and Dainik Tribune (in Hindi).
